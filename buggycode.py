#1. Nested Decisions: The Adventure Game üè∞ Objective: To practice the use of nested if statements.
# Task 1: Code Correction You are provided with a Python script that is 
# supposed to guide a user through an adventure game, 
# but it has some errors. Identify and fix them.

place = input("Choose a place: forest or cave? ")

if place == "forest":
    action = input("climb a tree or cross a river?")
    if action == "climb a tree":
        print("You found a bird's nest!")
    else:
        print("You found a boat!")
elif place == "cave":
#Task 2: Setting the Scene Based on your corrected code from Task 1, expand the game. 
# If the user chooses "cave", ask them if they want to "light a torch" or "proceed in the dark", 
# and provide outcomes for each decision.    
    action = input("light a torch or proceed in the dark")
    if action == "light a torch":
        print("You find a hidden treasure!")
    elif action == "proceed in the dark":
        print("You trip over a large object!")
#Task 3: Default Path If the user makes an invalid choice at any point, incorporate a pass statement 
# to handle it. HINT: How can an else statement be of use here?       
    else:pass
